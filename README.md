--> My Mini Python Projects  

This repo has 3 small Python projects I made while learning.  
Theyâ€™re simple but helped me understand OOP, file handling, and some data structures.  

1. Personal Finance Tracker  
- Lets you add incomes & expenses.  
- Saves transactions in a JSON file.  
- You can **view, search, filter, and sort** transactions.  
- Has a simple text-based chart for spending.  

 File: `finance.py`

2. Library Management System  
- Manage books (add/remove/list/search).  
- Keeps track of members.  
- Members can borrow/return books.  
- Saves data in JSON so nothing is lost.  

File: `library.py`

3. Hospital Patient Queue System  
- Two queues: Critical patients (priority) and Normal patients (FIFO).  
- Always serves critical patients first.  
- Calculates wait time for each patient.  
- Keeps history of served patients in a JSON file.  

File: `hospital.py`
