--> My Mini C++ Projects  

This repo has 3 small C++ projects I made while learning.  
Theyâ€™re simple but helped me understand OOP, file handling, and some data structures.  

1. Personal Finance Tracker  
- Lets you add incomes & expenses.    
- You can **view, search, filter, and sort** transactions.  
- Has a simple text-based chart for spending.  

 File: `finance.cpp`

2. Library Management System  
- Manage books (add/remove/list/search).  
- Keeps track of members.  
- Members can borrow/return books.    

File: `library.cpp`

3. Hospital Patient Queue System  
- Two queues: Critical patients (priority) and Normal patients (FIFO).  
- Always serves critical patients first.  
- Calculates wait time for each patient.   

File: `hospital.cpp`
